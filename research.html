<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Experience shapes what questions we
ask. Throughout the years, I’ve had the privilege of experiencing and living in
different cultures. As an English major in China, language provided me a window
into the western context. As an exchange student at Missouri State University,
I was exposed to political science concepts that piqued my curiosity into processes
of policy-making and empowerment in consumers. As an MBA student, I was
introduced to the ever-changing perceptions in retailing which seemed
interesting to explore. These experiences have shaped how I think about and
conduct research today. At the University of Oregon, I have had the opportunity
to work with scholars that help me channel my curiosity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">My research interests lie in how perceptions
of individuals’ social interactions (i.e. status, sense of power) influence the
effectiveness of marketing communications, such as advertisements, promotion,
and public policy messages, aimed at influencing consumption and pro-social
behaviors. More importantly, how to use this knowledge to motivate consumers to
engage in sustainable consumption and lifestyles such as healthy eating and
environmentally conscious behaviors. I strive to provide theoretical insights
and empirical applications through lab experiments, field studies, and surveys,
as well as analyses of secondary data. My dissertation centers on one important
motivating social force—sense of power. I examine how consumers’ sense of power
impacts their perceptions and decision-making in various marketing contexts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:0cm;margin-right:-9.0pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0cm"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The
study of power is intriguing to me. Research on power has reported that a
variety of behavioral consequences are a function of power states, such as
people’s propensity to take action, financial risk-taking, spending
preferences, and status signaling. Surprisingly, little research has examined how
consumers’ sense of power influences their sustainable consumption and
lifestyle. The first essay of my dissertation examines how individuals’ sense
of power influences food choices, specifically healthy food versus hedonic food.
Will empowering consumers increase their willingness to consume healthier food?
My findings suggest that when primed with high sense of power, consumers are
more willing to purchase healthy food; when primed with low sense of power,
consumers are more willing to purchase hedonic food. I also find a boundary
condition—when the communication message adopts an assertive tone, the
preference pattern for different types of food reverses. Consumers primed with
a low sense of power indicated stronger willingness to purchase healthy food.
This finding is novel in that the negative effect of assertive messages is dominant
in previous literature, but my research shows that assertive messages can
encourage and motivate consumers to eat healthier when they are low in power or
socioeconomic status. This paper, coauthored with my advisor, Dr. Jiao Zhang, is
currently under review at <i>Journal of
Consumer Research</i>. My second essay extends these findings to a public
transportation context with an emphasis on the interaction effect of sense of
power and message assertiveness, and I am currently preparing this manuscript
for submission at <i>Journal of Consumer
Psychology</i>. My third essay integrates gain/loss frames in the context of
conservation behaviors such as recycling. All my three essays share the theme
that aims to provide insights on effective communication to improve low-power
consumers’ well-being. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Over the past few years in the
doctoral program, I have taken courses with scholars and experts in the related
fields and actively engaged in research and publishing in my interested areas.
My early interest in cross-cultural research resulted in the publication of a
paper in <i>Personality &amp; Individual
Differences</i>. This paper reviews attempts to measure belief in a just world
(BJW) in disparate social science literatures, and empirically tests the
validity of the Global Belief in a Just World Scale (GBJWS). My coauthor and I
use the GBJWS to show that, contrary to previous findings, Eastern cultures may
have a larger overall BJW than Western cultures. Encouraged by reviewers, this
novel finding has been extended to an ongoing research that explores implicit
versus explicit luxury consumption in eastern and western cultures. In the new
project, we investigate whether and to what extent individuals in China receive
functional benefits by conspicuously displaying luxury goods on their person,
and to compare benefits to those received by individuals in the US. We propose
that BJW explains the variance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">In the area of online retailing and
promotion, a manuscript on the topic of online shopping cart abandonment,
co-authored with Dr. Hong Yuan and Dr. Atul Kulkarni, is ready to be at <i>Journal of Marketing Research </i>July 2016.
In this paper, we investigate a common phenomenon in the digital era – online
shopping cart abandonment from a promotional reactance perspective. We find
that the incentive type (reward vs. avoidance) of a promotional offer and
shoppers’ individual status in reaching the promotional threshold (the relative
sizes of planned versus incentivized, unplanned purchase) jointly influence the
abandonment decision. The current research not only identifies a model that
predicts shopping cart abandonment with incentive types and planned purchase
size, but also provides evidence for the psychological process that underlies
the effects. The studies show that when the planned purchase is relatively larger
than the incentivized, unplanned purchase, reward type incentives (e.g. free
gift) lead to higher shopping cart abandonment intentions. The perceived value
of the planned purchase mediates this effect. When the planned purchase is
relatively smaller than incentivized, unplanned purchase, avoidance type
incentives (e.g. free shipping) lead to higher shopping cart abandonment intentions.
The perceived fairness of the promotion mediates this effect. Our studies also indicate
that it is not always a good idea to remind people about sales promotion. If
shoppers are incentivized but couldn’t reach the threshold, the promotion could
backfire. Managers could minimize potential psychological or behavioral
reactance by selectively not sending reminders to some shoppers based on their
shopping status. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">By leading and actively working on
these projects, I have developed a pipeline of research aimed at understanding
how consumers’ perceived interactions and status with others impact their
consumption and conservation behaviors. I am prepared to start a career as an
independent researcher with a strong research stream. I look forward to
collaborating with my current co-authors and developing new research
relationships. In three years, I see myself turning my dissertation essays into
impactful publications, starting new work on power and marketing communication,
and moving along projects that I recently started. In 10 years, I hope to have
publications centered on power in mainstream outlets, be known as the
researcher of power in marketing and look more into public policy outcomes and
specific strategies for consumers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left:9.0pt"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:
11.5pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Across four studies, this research
shows that a sense of high power leads to higher purchase intent for healthy
food while a sense of low power leads to higher purchase intent for hedonic
food. When combined with marketing communication efforts, such as an assertive message,
this pattern reverses. High power leads to stronger preferences for tasty,
hedonic food while low power leads to stronger preferences for healthy food. Consumers’
sense of power and message assertiveness jointly influence the perceived
healthy value and hedonic value of the food product, and contribute to the purchase
intent differences among consumers at different levels of sense of power. A
main takeaway from this research is that when encouraging people to eat
healthier, different types of messages should be adopted for individuals from different
power groups.</span></p>

sustainable lifestyle, such as using public transportation, non-assertive
messages are more effective for consumers with high sense of power, while
assertive messages are more effective for consumers with low sense of power.
When we manipulate the authoritativeness of the message source (high versus
low), high power consumers find assertive messages more motivating when the
message come from a low authoritative organization, and a non-assertive message
more motivating when the message comes from a high authoritative organization.
However, low power consumers show the opposite pattern. The perceived
congruency between the message type and message source, as well as the
reactance toward the incongruence explain the underlying mechanism.</span></p>

benefits by conspicuously displaying luxury goods on their person, and to
compare benefits to those received by individuals in the US. In short, we
expect someone in China wearing luxury apparel to receive significantly better
treatment from strangers (operationalized as permission to use their cell
phone) than someone wearing non-luxury apparel. Although we also expect to
observe this pattern in the US, we predict that the difference between luxury
