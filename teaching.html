<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:115%"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">I was born in the
hometown of Confucius, China’s greatest philosopher and educator, so I have
always appreciated the work of a teacher. Some of my close family members are
school teachers and college professors.&nbsp;
While growing up, I watched how they interact with their students and
develop close teacher-student relationships. My teaching philosophy holds that
if the teacher pays careful attention and displays devotion, every student can
succeed. Teaching is not limited to the classroom or bounded by the teaching
schedule. It entails study, careful preparation of materials, thoughtful
assignments, and authentic interaction with students outside of class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:115%"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">My teaching style has
evolved over the last four years at Oregon through direct experience of
developing curricula and teaching courses, and by using the feedback I receive
to improve. My approach centers on involving students in actively engaging with
the material through discussion, cases, group exercises, and written
assignments. I believe that students need this active engagement to not only
grasp the core ideas of a class, but to understand how these ideas apply to
both the business world and their current lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:115%"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">In addition to attending
to each student’s performance in class, I work to facilitate the learning
process. I send each one of my students an individual survey before class
begins every term. I ask them to list what they want to learn most from this
class and which evaluation formats they prefer. I design my class based on the
teaching guidelines from the department but customize it according to students’
needs. When I deliver my lectures, I incorporate real life situations and examples
based on my own working experience and encourage students to think beyond the
text book and other learning materials.&nbsp;
Realizing that students struggle to understand abstract and intellectual
concepts, I use vivid in-class activities to increase their engagement and
interest in learning. For example, in my introduction to marketing’s classic
four P’s (Product, Price, Place, Promotion), I ask students to get into groups
and work on a lemonade stand project that could be implemented the coming
weekend to raise funds for the local elementary school. With real life
scenarios, students are more thorough in planning and implementing the four
P’s. My students tell me this is a very effective way for them to understand,
apply and remember these concepts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:115%"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">I share my passion for
marketing with my students. For example, at the beginning of the term, one of
my students, Alex Costello, found marketing boring and regularly arrived for
class late and left early.. When I sat down with him, he told me that he was
fascinated by computer science and had no interest at all in marketing. During
our one-hour conversation, I explained to him how computer science knowledge
could support quantitative analysis of Big Data to impact companies, consumers,
and the market. He became inspired and started to see the value of the field of
marketing. He ended up being one of the most actively participating and best
performing students in class.&nbsp; In his
course evaluation, he wrote: <i>"Prof.
Wang was awesome. I'm usually skeptical of foreign teachers because of the
language barrier, but Cindy was a total exception to this. She was very clear,
smart, and passionate. Honestly, I think her biggest strength was the fact she
cared. So many professors don't care, but Cindy really wanted to make an impact
on her students -- and it showed."</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:115%"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">As a teacher, I make
myself very accessible both in and outside of the classroom. I believe every
student, regardless of their performance in class, deserves a teacher’s full
attention.&nbsp; In every class that I teach,
I devote at least one half hours outside of class to meet with each of my
students individually. This takes considerable time for a large class, but I
find it to be worthwhile. As one student wrote in his evaluation: "<i>Cindy did an excellent job getting to know
students and I give her kudos for her ability to get all students introduced to
her one-on-one during office hours. I think that introducing yourself to your
professor is something important that most students overlook and I give her all
the credit for requiring students to do so. I also think that she keeps up to
date material in her slides and really enables class time interaction with her
"question for you" slides and her in-class interactive
activities."</i> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;line-height:115%"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">In short, I make myself
approachable and accessible whenever and however students need me. I create a
personal relationship with students so that they feel comfortable coming to me
for help with the course as well as other problems they encounter in life.&nbsp; I value this trust. </span><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
